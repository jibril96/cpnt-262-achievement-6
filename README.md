# Reflection

- For this accomplishment, I largely relied on Ash's examples from class and notes I took.

* I experienced a problem with `npm run serve`.

* I had to reinstall the `node-module` via vscode and run sever to access App loacal and network.

* To access App local and network, I had to reload the `node-module` using vscode `npm I` and run serve.

- I learned that Slot props allow us to turn slots into reusable templates capable of displaying different content based on input attributes. This is particularly useful for developing a reusable component that separates data functionality while allowing the consuming parent component to change a section of its appearance.

- The Net Ninja youtuber was quite helpful.

* I began to comprehend better after watching the videos and examining the class notes and lectures.
